# gentle-nudge

Chrome extension for starting automatic timers to remind you to get off sites.

Eg. When you instinctively open Facebook and start scrolling down your news feed, looking at events,
or talking with friends that you lose track of the time. Sometimes you need a gentle nudge after a
minute to get back to what you were doing earlier.
